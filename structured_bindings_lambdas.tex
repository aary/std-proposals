\section{Introduction}

This paper proposes usage of structured with polymorphic lambdas, adding them
to another place where \texttt{auto} can be used as a declarator

\begin{lstlisting}
auto map = std::map<int, int>{{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
std::for_each((map, [](auto [key, value]) {
    cout << key << " " << value << endl;
});
\end{lstlisting}

This would make for nice syntactic sugar to situations such as the above
without having to decompose the tuple-like object manually, similar to how
structured bindings are used in range based for loops

\begin{lstlisting}
auto map = std::map<int, int>{{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
for (auto [key, value] : map) {
    cout << key << " " << value << endl;
}
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Simplicity and uniformity}
Structured binding initialization can be used almost anywhere \texttt{auto} is
used to initialize a variable (not considering \texttt{auto} deduced return
types), and allowing this to happen in polymorphic lambdas would make code
simpler, easier to read and generalize better

\begin{lstlisting}
std::find_if(range, [](const auto& [key, value]) {
    return examine(key, value);
});
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Programmer demand}
There is some programmer demand and uniform agreement on this feature

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45541334}{Stack Overflow:
        Can the structured bindings syntax be used in polymorphic lambdas}
    \item \href{https://goo.gl/fRSwNg}{ISO C++ : Structured bindings and
        polymorphic lambdas}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prevalence}
It is not uncommon to execute algorithms on containers that contain a value
type that is either a tuple or a tuple-like decomposable class.  And in such
cases code usually deteriorates to manually unpacking the instance of the
decomposable class for maximum reaadability, for example

\begin{lstlisting}
auto result = std::count_if(map, [](const auto& key_value_pair) {
    const auto& key = key_value_pair.first;
    const auto& value = key_value_pair.second;

    return examine(key, process_key(key), value);
});
\end{lstlisting}

The first two lines in the lambda are just noise and can nicely be replaced
with structured bindings in the function parameter

\begin{lstlisting}
auto result = std::count_if(map, [](const auto& [key, value]) {
    return examine(key, process_key(key), value);
});
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Impact on the standard}
The proposal describes a pure language extension which is a non-breaking
change - code that was previously ill-formed now would have well-defined
semantics.


\section{Interaction with concepts}
If a type can be decomposed into a structured binding expression with
\texttt{x} bindings, then it is said to be \texttt{x-decomposable} (reference
\texttt{[dcl.struct.bind]} for the exact requirements).  Any compiler
diagnostics provided are the same as that for regular structured bindings
initializations - a compiler concept that determines if a type is
\texttt{x-decomposable}.

Part of such a concept can be made using the tools available to the
programmer.  In particular, it is possible to make a concept or SFINAE trait
that enables us to check if a type is decomposable via a member or ADL defined
free \texttt{get<>()} method/function and the existence of a specialized
\texttt{std::tuple\_size<>} and \texttt{std::tuple\_size<>} traits

From the current working draft of the C++17 standard
\texttt{[dcl.struct.bind]}p2 and \texttt{[dcl.struct.bind]}p3 define
decomposability that can be checked by the programmer at compile time via a
concept or SFINAE trait.  However \texttt{[dcl.struct.bind]}p4 describes a
method of unpacking that cannot be enforced purely by the language constructs
available as of C++17.  As such a concept provided by the compiler is
required.

This concept \texttt{std::decomposable<x>} shall be a concept that accepts a
non type template parameter of type \texttt{std::size\_t} that determines the
cardinality of the structured bindings decomposition.  This concept holds if a
type is \texttt{x-decomposable} (and this will take into consideration the
requirements set forth by \texttt{[dcl.struct.bind]} paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.


\section{Impact on overloading and function resolution}
Lambdas do not natively support function overloading, however one can lay out
lambdas in a way that they are overloaded, for example

\begin{lstlisting}
template <typename... Types> struct Overload { using Types::operator()...; };
template <typename... Types> Overload(Types...) -> Overload<Types...>;

namespace {
    auto one = [](int) {};
    auto two = [](char) {};
    auto overloaded = Overload{one, two};
} // namespace <anonymous>
\end{lstlisting}

And in such a situation the consequences of this proposal must be considered.
The easiest way to understand this proposal is to consider the rough syntactic
sugar that this provides.  A polymorphic lambda with a structured binding
declaration translates to a simple functor with a templated
\texttt{operator()} method with the structured binding "decomposition"
happening inside the function

\begin{lstlisting}
auto lambda = [](auto [key, value]) { ... };

/**
 * Expansion of the above lambda in C++14 form with respect to overloading
 */
struct ANONYMOUS_LAMBDA {
    template <std::decomposable<2> Type>
    auto operator()(Type&& instance) {
        auto [key, value] = std::forward<Type>(instance);
        ...
    }
};
\end{lstlisting}

(Note that the above is just for illustration purposes.  It has some
differences with the way such a lambda would translate into real code - for
example, the forwarded instance prevents elision because it is an xvalue and
further returning a value from the structured bindings in the initialization
would not be a candidate for NRVO in any case because of the explicit
disallowance in \texttt{[class.copy.elision]})

Given the above expansion, a polymorphic lambda behaves identically to a
lambda with a \textt{auto} parameter type with the difference that these are
constrained to work only with parameters that are \texttt{x} decomposable.
And nothing special happens when overloading

\begin{lstlisting}
template <typename... Types> struct Overload { using Types::operator()...; };
template <typename... Types> Overload(Types...) -> Overload<Types...>;

namespace {
    auto one = [](int) {};
    auto two = [](auto [key, value]) {};
    auto overloaded = Overload{one, two};
} // namespace <anonymous>

int main() {
    auto integer = int{1};
    auto pair = std::make_pair(1, 2);
    auto error = double{1};

    // calls the lambda named "one"
    overloaded(integer);
    // calls the lamdba named "two"
    overloaded(pair);
    // error
    overloaded(error);
}
\end{lstlisting}

Further, one key point to consider here is that the concept based constraints
on such lambdas allows for the following two orthogonal overloads to work
nicely with each other

\begin{lstlisting}
namespace {
    auto lambda_one = [](auto [one, two]) {};
    auto lambda_two = [](auto [one, two, three]) {};
    auto overloaded = Overload{lambda_one, lambda_two};
} // namespace <anonymous>

int main() {
    auto tup_one = std::make_tuple(1, 2);
    auto tup_two = std::make_tuple(1, 2, 2);
    overloaded(tup_one);
    overloaded(tup_two);

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Since here either one lambda can be called or both, in no case can both
satisfy the requirements set forth by the compiler concept
\texttt{std::decomposable<x>}


\section{Exceptions}
Exceptions during "unwrapping" (if, for example a member or free ADL defined
\texttt{get<>} throws) will propagate from the call site, just as with regular
polymorphic lambdas
